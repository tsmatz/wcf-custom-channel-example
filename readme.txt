/// This demo is for :

  Transport level custom channel sample.
  This uses a file for WCF communication.

/// How to install

1. Modify endpoint address in web.config at SampleServer and SampleClient.
  The directory must be created ! (Default is c:\tmp)
2. Launch SampleServer, and connect using SampleClient.

Note ! : This is only for a simple channel demo.
  Using foolish style connection, and not supporting many things (metadata exchange, etc etc).
